# To-Do List App

## Description
This project is written using React in Vite. It is a to-do list app that allows a user to add, edit, or remove items from a to-do list. A user can also update the status of a list item. The app is responsive to multiple screen sizes. 

## Installation
1. Code editing software is required to run this project on your local machine. GitHub also offers their own free software called [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) which can be downloaded if needed. 
2. Create and/or open a folder where you want to save the repository. In your code editor, navigate to that folder. Clone the repository using an SSH key by typing the following command into your terminal: `git clone git@github.com:vnewto/react-to-do-list.git`
3. Change your directory to the correct repository by typing the terminal command `cd react-to-do-list`  
4. Install the project requirements using the terminal command `npm install`. This will install all the required dependencies that are listed in the package.json file.

## Running the Development Server
Once installation is complete, you can now run the project, view, and edit the code. To see live changes, run the development server by typing the following into your terminal: `npm run dev`
Your terminal will show you a link:

Click on the localhost link to view the live server.

## Troubleshooting
If you are unable to clone the repository to your local machine, check your coding program for updates.
If the live server is not loading in the browser, check your internet connection.

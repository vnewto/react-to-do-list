                This project is written using React in Vite. It is a to-do list
                app that allows a user to add, edit, or remove items from a
                to-do list. A user can change the status of an item to Complete,
                thus removing it from the UI. The list can be sorted
                alphabetically or by when each item was added. The app is
                responsive to multiple screen sizes.{' '}
